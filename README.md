# MultiAgentMotionPlanning

## Overview
A basic motion planning framework that we can use to animate groups of agents navigating in complex environments with a variety of obstacles. The simulated agents could avoid collisions with both obstacles and other agents, while still reaching their goals. A global navigation structure has been incorporated here to allow the agents to navigate through complex environment without getting stuck at local minima.
